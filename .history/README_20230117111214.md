##API/s Used in this project

####[Lost and Found](https://www.lostandfound.com/api)

The LostAndFound API allows developers to programmatically access web-based lost and found services, including reporting and search capabilities. These services cover all kinds of public venues, including airports, hotels, car rentals, stadiums, restaurants, and more. Users can add their own venue pages and use them to report and display lost and found information for that location. Alternatively, users can retrieve information from an existing venue page for use elsewhere.

####[Place Dog](https://place.dog/) and [Place Kitten](https://placekitten.com/)

Place.dog and PlaceKitten enable users to add random photos of dogs and cats to use as a placeholder in websites or applications with one simple line of code.

####[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)

An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps

###[FoundAPI]()

A user-generated API of missing pets (via sqlite3)
